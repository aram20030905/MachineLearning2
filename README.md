Employee Interview Acceptance Prediction Model
Project Overview
This project is focused on predicting whether an employee will be accepted for an interview based on various attributes such as age, education, business travel, marital status, gender, overtime, daily rate, and other features. The primary goal is to use machine learning algorithms to classify employees into two categories: those accepted for an interview and those not accepted.

We implement three classification models in this project:

Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Naive Bayes
The models are trained and evaluated using a dataset, and their performance is compared based on accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Dataset
The dataset (logatta.csv) contains various features related to employees, such as:

Age
Employee Number
Daily Rate
Education Level
Business Travel Frequency
Marital Status
Gender
Overtime Hours
The target variable (accepted for the interview) indicates whether an employee was accepted for an interview (binary classification: 1 = accepted, 0 = not accepted).

Features of the Model
Logistic Regression: A regression-based algorithm used for binary classification problems. It predicts the probability that an employee will be accepted for an interview based on the features provided.
Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classification method based on Bayes' theorem, commonly used when the features are assumed to be conditionally independent.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A non-parametric algorithm that predicts the class of an instance by looking at the majority class among its nearest neighbors in the feature space.
Model Development Process
Step 1: Download the Dataset
Download the logatta.csv file and store it in your project directory.

Step 2: Import Necessary Libraries
We use the following Python libraries:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical computations.
matplotlib and seaborn: For data visualization.
sklearn: For machine learning models and metrics.
Step 3: Data Preprocessing
Ordinal Encoding: The categorical features such as Education, BusinessTravel, MaritalStatus, OverTime, and Gender are encoded into numerical values using OrdinalEncoder.
Standard Scaling: Features such as Age, Employee Number, and Daily Rate are scaled using StandardScaler to normalize the values.
Step 4: Visualization
Various plots are used to understand the distribution of key features:

Age Distribution: A histogram showing the distribution of employee ages.
Business Travel Distribution: A count plot showing the frequency of business travel among employees.
Education Level Distribution: A count plot displaying the different education levels of employees.
Marital Status Distribution: A pie chart visualizing the percentage of employees with different marital statuses.
Overtime Distribution: A count plot illustrating whether employees worked overtime.
Daily Rate Distribution: A boxplot of daily rates among employees.
Gender Distribution: A count plot displaying the gender distribution among employees.
Step 5: Model Training and Evaluation
The dataset is split into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing). The models are trained using the following classification algorithms:

Logistic Regression: Trained with max_iter=1000 to ensure convergence.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Trained with n_neighbors=5.
Naive Bayes: Gaussian Naive Bayes is used for classification.
Step 6: Model Testing
Each model is tested on the testing set, and the following metrics are displayed for each model:

Accuracy Score: Measures how well the model performs on unseen data.
Confusion Matrix: A matrix that shows the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
Classification Report: Provides precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

Model Selection
After evaluating the performance of each model, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) was chosen as the final model due to its superior accuracy (89.5%) compared to Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes. KNN is particularly effective in scenarios where there are complex, non-linear relationships between features.

Reasons for Model Choice:
Logistic Regression: Although it performed well, it assumes a linear relationship between the features and target, which may not always hold in real-world scenarios.
Naive Bayes: While it is efficient for categorical data, it did not perform as well as KNN on this dataset.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): KNN is a versatile model that doesn't assume any specific data distribution, making it highly effective for this problem.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting employee interview acceptance. By comparing different models, we identified that K-Nearest Neighbors is the most accurate and efficient algorithm for this dataset.

Future Work
Cross-validation: Implement cross-validation to further evaluate model performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Tune the hyperparameters of KNN and other models for better performance.
Feature Engineering: Experiment with additional features and feature selection methods to improve model accuracy.
